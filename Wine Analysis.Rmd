## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. This document deals with EDA and prediction of Wine datasets

Reading wine Datasets
```{r}
setwd("E:/UW - Edu/Term 2/MSCI 718 - SDA/Assignments/Asgn3/Wine dataset")
red.wine<-read.csv("winequality-red.csv",sep=";",colClasses = c(rep("numeric",11)))
red.wine["color"]=1
white.wine<-read.csv("winequality-white.csv",sep=";",colClasses = c(rep("numeric",11)))
white.wine["color"]=0
wine<-rbind(red.wine,white.wine)
describe(wine)
```


##ANALYSIS

After planning which predictor variable we can work with, we check for the assumptions that should be met in order to build a regression model to predict the quality of wine.
1. Predictor variables should be quantitative, conitnuous and unbounded
 - Can be seen from the data set that they are
 
2. Outcome variable should be quantitative, continuous and unbounded
 - Even though in the data set, we see that our outcome variable i.e. quantity, is categorical, but in te data description it is given as a range from 1-10. So we can assume that the data is quantitative and continuous. 
 - We also assume its unbounded.
 
3. Non - zero variance
 - it can be seen that there is some variance in between every pair of variable.
 

Model
```{r}
winemodel1<-lm(quality ~ volatile.acidity+alcohol+free.sulfur.dioxide + sulphates, na.action = na.omit, data=wine)
summary(winemodel)
confint(winemodel)
```

We build a coulpe of models more to analyse which one could be a better predicto, pertaining to the fact that these vaiables have almost same individual correlation with the outcome variable

```{r}
winemodel2<-lm(quality ~ volatile.acidity+alcohol+free.sulfur.dioxide + chlorides , na.action = na.omit, data=wine)
winemodel3<-lm(quality ~ volatile.acidity+alcohol+free.sulfur.dioxide + residual.sugar , na.action = na.omit, data=wine)
AIC(winemodel1)
AIC(winemodel2)
AIC(winemodel3)
anova(winemodel1,winemodel2)
```

So we go with the initial model we chose as the best model


Multicolinearity

```{r}
vif(winemodel1)
tolerance <- 1/vif(winemodel1)
tolerance
```
 The tolerance levels are pretty much in range and the VIF values are low too. So we can conclude that there is no multicollinearity
 
Residual Analysis
```{r}
plot(winemodel1)
```

1. Durbin watson Test
```{r}
durbinWatsonTest(winemodel1)
```
It lies within the acceptable range of 1.5 to 2.5, hence can be concluded that residuals are independent

2. From the graph of residuals vs fitted values it can be seen that the mean line is horizontal hence the variance is contant

3.Normal Q-Q plot


Assesssing the model
Residual Tests

```{r}
wineData<-wine
#temp<-wineData[-6345,]

wineData$residuals<-resid(winemodel1)
wineData$stdresiduals<-rstandard(winemodel1)
wineData$sturesiduals<-rstudent(winemodel1)
wineData$cooksDistance<-cooks.distance(winemodel1)
wineData$dfbeta<-dfbeta(winemodel1)
wineData$dffits<-dffits(winemodel1)
wineData$leverage<-hatvalues(winemodel1)
wineData$covratio<-covratio(winemodel1)
wineData$large.resid<-wineData$stdresiduals>1.96 | wineData$stdresiduals< -1.96
sum(wineData$large.resid)/nrow(wineData)

```
Linearity of Residuals
```{r}
plot(wineData$residuals) #Looks linear


wineData[wineData$large.resid,c("cooksDistance","leverage","covratio")]
#cooksdistance not >1, leverage 2*(9+1)/nrow(wineData)
#1 + 30/nrow(wineData) --can remove 6345
summary(wineData)

wineData[6345,]

```

RESIDUALS
```{r}

plot(wineData$residuals)
plot(winemodel3)

```
